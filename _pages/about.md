I'm now a Lecturer at the School of Information Science and Engineering, [Chongqing Jiaotong University](https://www.cqjtu.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. from the [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zhigang Luo, Prof. Yonggang Che and [Prof. Xinwang Liu](https://xinwangliu.github.io/). My research interests span multimodal information fusion, information extraction, and the cognitive mechanisms of LLMs. I currently serve as an M.S. advisor and welcome prospective students who wish to explore either (i) cognition in social-media contexts or (ii) the intersection of bridge maintenance and LLM models.
